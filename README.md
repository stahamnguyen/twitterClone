# Twitter Clone
This is my own project building an iOS application in Swift about using TRON framework to handle data in JSON format and display them.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
Xcode 8 or above has been installed in your computer

## Installing
Clone the code to your computer and open with Xcode 8 or above

## Language
Swift 4

## Functionalities
Fetch data in JSON format from a pre-defined Twitter-like API and display the data like Twitter layout. Buttons in this application
have no functionality and only serve as UI component

## Performed skills:
1. Storyboard is eliminated. Layout and functionalities are all completed programmatically.
2. Implement TRON framework to handle data in JSON format
3. Implement LBTAComponents framework to simplify the data connection of UICollectionView

## Versioning:
#### Sep 28, 2017 - 1.0
